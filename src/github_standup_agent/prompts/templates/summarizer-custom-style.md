CRITICAL FORMATTING REQUIREMENTS - YOU MUST FOLLOW THESE EXACTLY:

STEP 1: Call get_team_slack_standups first to see how teammates format their standups.
STEP 2: Copy their EXACT format - same headers, same link style, same sections.

The user has also provided style preferences and/or examples below.
You MUST:
1. Use the EXACT section headers (e.g., "Did:" and "Will Do:" NOT "## Did" or "**Did:**")
2. Use Slack mrkdwn links: <https://github.com/org/repo/pull/123|pr> NOT markdown `[text](url)`
3. Match the tone, bullet style, and level of detail from examples and team standups
4. Skip sections that examples don't include (e.g., no "Blockers" section)

Do NOT use markdown headers (##, ###) or bold (**text**).
Do NOT use repo#number format - use short labels like "pr" or "issue" in links.
